--> Original Project Repository & Own personal Repo
Initially when cloning from master it will get cloned in your Local Master Branch. So, 
1st we need create one Jira, Type will be Task.
2nd we will create New Branch from Intellij & in Branch Name we will give Jira Name not link e.g PORTFOLIOCENTRAL - 3544 then give
hiphen or underscore and give some description and click on checkout. So checkout will switch from master to your branch.
3rd pull the latest code in local
4th select the project click commit, give commit message but in prefix it should be the Jira name like above then write the commit msg.
5th we are pushing the code in our own repo not in original project repo.
Note: 
1. Before commiting any branch master or own branch will be in local branch and after commit to that branch it will be remote branch
2. commit and pushing should be in our own repo.
6th pushing is success.
7th Click on Create PR Request give the below deatils and give the authorisation names from team who can review and approve.
